# Status-Tracker
Using Python on a Raspberry Pi 3B, a user will be able to track their actions and tendencies with Status Tracker. Status Tracker allows users to press a button that corresponds with a user's current actions (such as reading, playing games, sleeping, eating, etc.) and will time the action. Each of these actions are linked to one of 5 distinct LEDs to tell the user what action is being currently tracked. Each of these actions are timed and the data will be analyzed and extrapolated to the user's desires.
